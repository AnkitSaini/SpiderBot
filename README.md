SpiderBot
=========

This repository contains code for the SpiderBot - a canvass painting robot that I made during my internship at The 
IdeazFactory during summers of 2014. 

To control the position of robot on canvass and the color sprayed by it ,intially I built a web interface using HTML5 and 
PHP. The interface was not working properly on mobile devices. So to avoid building an interface from scratch, I took 
advantage of the existing platforms. I built an interface tweets "@thepaintingrobot" using opensource platforms
Processing and Twitter4j library.
